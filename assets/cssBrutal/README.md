# NEO-BRUTALISM

Most changes here have been made in layout.css with `.wrapper` with a `<div class="wrapper"></div>` within `<body></body>` but around all other content and within base in regard to typography and the removal of the `.round-img` class in favour of `header img{}` styling. 

The `businesscard.css` module has been introduced for the index page and places the module at `felx-end` with a pink `border`. 

Otherwise very few changes has been made in the code with mostly few tweaks here and there. 

Take a look around the code and compare it to the original code in the `css` folder to see how much can be changed with minimal code.


## The design
Brutalism is a special breed of web design, working well for quirky, creative brands and individuals. However, this rule-bending design technique must be employed with care. Read this guide to find out how.

### My thoughts
I wanted to keep as much as possible of the original design including the colours. The point was to do as little new code as possible. Also to illustrate how much can be achieved with minimal change.
