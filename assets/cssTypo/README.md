# Typographic hero image

I've changed the header image to fill out the screen and take a backgroudn function with `position: fixed;` and `z-index: -10;` and be transparent and enlargened the header text. Through `<span></span>` I've added the `--accent-font` in a class for a single word in the header text. The `h1` has been given a limited width and an alignment to `flex-start`.

I've changed very little beside typography and added background colours to single elements. 

## The design
Is imagery really necessary in the hero section of the home page? For some brands it might be. Product imagery or even the face of the founder or entrepreneur can instantly evoke a response that words alone might not. However, thatâ€™s not always the case.
